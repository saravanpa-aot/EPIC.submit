# EPIC.submit
A project for the Environmental Assessment Office to manage submissions

EPIC.submit is an online application that allows Certificate/Exemption Holders to submit
management plans and other post-certificate documents to the Environmental Assessment
Office (EAO). The system streamlines the submission process, tracks document versions, and
facilitates communication between users and the EAO.

### Who Should Use This Guide
- **Certificate/Exemption Holders**: Organizations that need to submit management plans and other documents to the EAO

### Key Benefits
- **Streamlined Submission Process**: Submit documents directly to the EAO online
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor the progress of your submissions
- **Version Control**: Keep track of document versions
- **Team Collaboration**: Work with team members on submissions
- **Direct Communication**: Receive feedback and requests from the EAO

## Submit Setup Instructions

This document outlines the setup instructions for both the backend and front-end components of the project. Ensure you follow the steps in sequence for a smooth setup.

## Backend Setup in WSL

### 1. Install Python 3.12.4
Ensure Python 3.12.4 is installed in your WSL environment. Download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3124/).

### 2. Set Up PYTHONPATH
Add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable:
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/submit-api:${PYTHONPATH}"

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your submit-api with the necessary configurations. Reference sample.env to see what variables you need to configure

### 4. Start Docker Compose
In a separate terminal, launch Docker Compose to set up your containers:
docker-compose up

### 5. Run Setup
Navigate to your project directory and run the setup command to prepare your development environment:
make setup

### 5. Run Server
Once the setup is completed use make run to start the server:
make run


## Backend Setup on Windows

## Step 1: Download Python 3.12.x

1. Visit the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download and install Python 3.12.x for your operating system.


## Step 4: Set Environment Variables

1. Set the `FLASK_APP` and `FLASK_ENV` environment variables:
    - set FLASK_APP=app.py 
      set FLASK_ENV=development
      
2. Configure `PYTHONPATH` to your project's folder location up to `submit-api/src`:
    - set PYTHONPATH=path\to\submit-api\src &&    PYTHONPATH=path\to\submit-api

## Step 2: Start Docker

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the `submit-api` directory:
    cd submit-api

3. Run the following command to start the services using Docker Compose:
    docker-compose up

## Step 3: Set Up `submit-api`

1. Open a separate terminal.

2. Navigate to the `` directory:
    cd submit-api

3. Create a virtual environment. Refer to the official Python documentation on how to create a virtual environment: [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
    py -3.12 -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    - venv\Scripts\activate

5. Install the required Python packages from both `dev.txt` and `prod.txt` requirements files:
    py -3.12 -m pip install -r path/to/requirements/dev.txt
    py -3.12 -m pip install -r path/to/requirements/prod.txt

6. Run your Flask app using the Flask CLI:
    - py -3.12 -m flask run -p 5000

## Front End Setup

### 1. Navigate to Front End Directory
Change to the front-end directory:
cd submit-web

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install necessary npm packages:
npm install

### 3. Run Development Server
Launch the development server:
npm run dev

# Helm
In openshift, you should have namespaces as such:
xxxx-tools
xxxx-dev
xxxx-test
xxxx-prod

After the oc login which can be gotten from the openshift command line tool page
install command https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/

## Patroni
You can reuse a patroni chart like https://github.com/bcgov/nr-patroni-chart
follow instructions on the link

- if the resource quota was exceeded you can change the values in values.yaml, you can always do that locally and install like this as well `$ helm install -f myvalues.yaml myredis ./redis`

## API

can reuse the charts here https://github.com/bcgov/EPIC.submit/tree/develop/deployment/charts the api and the api-bc

### *api.yml
Install it in the xxxx-dev with name xxx-api. Upon success you will have the DeploymentConfig, Route, Service, Secrets and ConfigMap

### *bc.yml
Install it in a xxxx-tools with bane yourApp-api. Upon success you will have BuildConfig and ImageStream.

The ImageStream is used to host the docker image in openshift registry and point to different build tags: latest, dev, etc.

The Deployment config will reference these builds using the tags

The BuildConfig is run to manually build a docker image and push it to the openshift registry

### Role Binding
You need to give the service account "default" image pulling permissions. Create an image pulling role and bind it to the default service account

### Network Policy

The tools namespace will be common to dev, test and prod and you will need to allow for connections between namespaces via Network policy:

You need a policy to allow pods in xxxx-dev to connect with each other
    spec:
    
    podSelector: {}
    
    ingress:
    
    - from:
    
    - namespaceSelector:
    
    matchLabels:
    
    environment: dev
    
    name: c8b80a
    
    policyTypes:
    
    - Ingress


# Github Workflows
you can find a working example here: https://github.com/bcgov/EPIC.submit/tree/main/.github/workflows

- create a github-action service account openshift in the tools namespace and bind to it image puller and image pusher roles
- Add the following secrets in the repo settings under repository secrets: OPENSHIFT_IMAGE_REGISTRY (the public image repository, ignore the path just the base  url), OPENSHIFT_LOGIN_REGISTRY (you can pull this from the same place you get your oc login command, OPENSHIFT_REPOSITORY, OPENSHIFT_SA_NAME (github_action), OPENSHIFT_SA_TOKEN(github-action token, find it in secrets)

# Codecov
if you intend to use codecov in your CI workflows, you have to go to the bcgov codecov account and register your app there, get a token and add it as a repo secret with name CODECOV_TOKEN

### JEST
example work yml for jest:

  testing:
    needs: setup-job
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          npm install --legacy-peer-deps
        env:
          FONTAWESOME_PACKAGE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FONTAWESOME_PACKAGE_TOKEN }}
    
      - name: Test with jest
        id: test
        run: |
          npm test -- --coverage
    
      # Set codecov branch name with prefix if pull request
      - name: Sets Codecov branch name
        run: |
          echo "CODECOV_BRANCH=PR_${{github.head_ref}}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    
      - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          flags: app-web
          name: codecov-app-web
          fail_ci_if_error: true
          verbose: true
          override_branch: ${{env.CODECOV_BRANCH}}
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
### Cypress
you have to add a some dev dependencies and set them up in the app and then you can use the below example yml for cypress:

      testing:
        needs: setup-job
        runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
          - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
            uses: actions/setup-node@v1
            with:
              node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: |
              npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    
          - name: Test with Cypress
            id: test
            run: |
              npx cypress run --component --headed --browser chrome
    
          - name: Sets Codecov branch name
            run: |
              echo "CODECOV_BRANCH=PR_${{ github.head_ref }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
            if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    
          - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
            uses: codecov/codecov-action@v4
            with:
              flags: app-web
              name: codecov-app-web
              fail_ci_if_error: true
              verbose: true
              override_branch: ${{ env.CODECOV_BRANCH }}
              token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
              directory: ./app-web/coverage
